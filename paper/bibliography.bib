abstract="Scene text recognition is gaining renewed interest owing to the increase of scene image based applications and new intelligent devices. Unlike recognition of printed text, scene text recognition is challenging due to the complexity of scene images. To provide an overview of the techniques and inspire future research, this paper reviews the advances in scene character and text recognition, with emphasize on character feature representation methods and word recognition models. The papers published in the most recent conferences ECCV 2014, ACCV 2014, ICIP 2014, and ICPR 2014 are also reviewed in this paper to provide the state-of-the-art of scene character and text recognition. The state-of-the-art performance is provided to show the achieved performance so far and demonstrate the potential of deep learning based methods.",

abstract="This paper compares the current state of the art in online Japanese character recognition with techniques in western handwriting recognition. It discusses important developments in preprocessing, classification, and postprocessing for Japanese character recognition in recent years and relates them to the developments in western handwriting recognition. Comparing eastern and western handwriting recognition techniques allows learning from very different approaches and understanding the underlying common foundations of handwriting recognition. This is very important when it comes to developing compact modules for integrated systems supporting many writing systems capable of recognizing multilanguage documents.",

abstract="This paper presents a pojection based method for segmenting handwritten Chinese characters in form documents with known structures. In the preprocessing phase, a noise removal method is proposed that preserves strike connections and character edge points. In the character segmentation phase, the projection profile analysis method is used to segment a text line image into projection blocks. In addition, projection blocks are classified into one of four types; mark, half-word, single-word, and two word. Large blocks are then split and small blocks are merged. In addition, an OCR system is adopted to eliminate errors resulting from the inappropriate merging of Chinese numerical characters with other characters. As for 1319 Chinese characters are tested during our experiments, the correct segmentation rates of 92.34{\%} and 91.76{\%} are obtained with and without the OCR module.",
