\label{sec:conclusion}

Based on the example shown in the results section and discussed in the discussion section we must conclude that the segmentation achieved seems good but could be better when more work is put in to it. Most examples handled in the discussion concluded in the same thing. Namely that some part of the system was faulty or that some parameter still needed to be tweaked more. Almost all problems shown could be handled by the methods implemented in the system. The connected components implementation together with horizontal and vertical projection shows promise and should (if worked out more) be  able to  achieve better results. This work however shows that a hybrid form can achieve segmentation with the best of both worlds.
