Introduction to the field

Why prepossessing is important

	- Noise reduction
	- Finding characters

Other methods and research done in this field.

Something about how a  (my version) is most of the times is a better solution than an extreme form.

The entire introduction should logically end at the research question and thesis statement or hypothesis.

	research question 	- How does the implemented segmentation method perform (in comparison with existing methods?)
	hypothesis			- Its probably oke for the time commited and the amount of work put in to it.
