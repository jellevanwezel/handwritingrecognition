% Do your results provide answers to your testable hypotheses? If so, how do you interpret your findings?
% Do your findings agree with what others have shown? If not, do they suggest an alternative explanation or perhaps a unforseen design flaw in your experiment (or theirs?)
% Given your conclusions, what is our new understanding of the problem you investigated and outlined in the Introduction?
% If warranted, what would be the next step in your study, e.g., what experiments would you do next?
